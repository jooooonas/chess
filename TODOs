- en passant for kick() and covered_spots()
- stalemate
- promotion
- copy_board in chess.py is not copying the pieces correctly -> inconsistency if posX and posY are changed
(- kings arent allowed to cuddle
- check if King is allowed to move to spot because of enemy king (in covered_spots and in check_move()))

Test castling!
